Continuing development from this state is **not a priority**.  
The project was built with an older approach, relying mainly on **jQuery** for interactivity and lacking the structure of modern development tools.  
It does not use technologies that make applications easier to maintain and expand today, such as **TypeScript** or frontend frameworks like **Vue** or **React**.
